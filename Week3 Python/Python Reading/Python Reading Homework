#Chapter 1

##One thing I knew
#####One thing I knew was that the most important skill for programming is problem solving. I knew it only because I learned it in last class. It was surprising to me because I thought that the important skills of programming are about building a new system which wasn’t in the computer before.

##One thing I didn't know
#####One thing I’ve learned from the reading is any terminologies and languages which are used in python. Because I haven’t learned or used python before, I didn’t know anything about operator or value and what is the function or meaning of those.

#Chapter 3

##One thing I knew
#####Everything was new information for me. Since I’ve never used python, every terminology and functions are new to me.

##One thing I didn't know
#####Every information in chapter 3 was new to me. However, a stack diagram was very interesting to me because I was always wondering how people keep on track while working on a long coding. So it was a good opportunity for me to learn those.

#Chapter 5

##One thing I knew
#####The things I already knew before the reading was the definition of boolean, and the definition of conditional, alternative, and chained executions. We’ve learned about boolean in the class, and I’ve learned the concept of conditional, alternative, and chained executions when we had a scratch homework.

##One thing I didn't know
#####Many parts of this chapter were new to me. Some executions I didn’t know and new concepts like floor division and modulu operator. I learned their concept, but I need to start using python to really understand their structures and roles.
