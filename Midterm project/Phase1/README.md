#Phase 1

#####I wanted the pattern to look more than one way when it all tiled together. It means that even it looks in only  one way when you look at just an one block of it, but you can see in two way when it tiled together. I chose one of the traditional Japanese pattern. It looks like a circle with diamond inside with just an one block, but it looks like petals when you tile it up.
#####When I read through the instruction on the class github, I saw that the size of the canvas was 150 in example of the Phase2. So I draw my sketch using 15x15 blocks so that it's easier for me to calculate. As I draw the sketch, I decided what color I wanted to use for the stroke and the fill as well.
