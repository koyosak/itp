# Pyramid
## what I did
##### First of all, I made the function which is going to print the character and how many times it's going to do. Secondly, I made the boolian to make the "count" only in the range of 1 to 8, and repeat if the number is not between 1 to 8. If the number is "True", it breaks the looping and go to the next part. Lastly, I made the loop for the characters. Because I made the function to print the character and tell it how much it has to do, I put a space as a character and I told the system to print the number of spaces which is the number you tapes in - variable for the left empty part of the pyramid. I also put # as the character and put the number of variables. I put print() at the end to actually execute this code.

## How I did
##### It was a lot of assembling process in my mind. I was even thinking of made the function at first. I tried to make the range of the number first. After that I made the function so that I can make the loop for printing the character more efficient by telling the computer that it's going to print the character for the given number times.

## The problem I faced
##### One of the biggest problem I faced was to make it as efficient as possible. I tried to put too much stuff in the one loop and it ended up not working out. Then my roommate suggested me to use fuctions to make it efficient. I made total of three loop and it worked, but it still worked above 8. Condition which I tried to make the range wasn't working. I asked my roommate for help again and he told me to make it boolian so that computer can understand it easier. And it worked!

## How I overcome it
##### My roommate helped me figure out this time. I tried to figure out by looking back on github class website, but it wasn't enough for my brain to understand and adapt it to this assignment. My roommate was a very good teacher and helped me figure out and helped me try to think in computer way.

# FizzBuzz
## What I did/How I did
##### I made the range of the variable from 1 to 100 at first. I used modulus to the 3 and 5 and put condition so that if the number is divisble by 3, it's going to print fizz and if it's by 5, it's going to print Buzz, and it's going to print FizzBuzz if it's divisible by both 3 and 5.

## The problem I faced
##### At first, I forgot to put print(index) at the last of my coding. What it did was counting 1 to 100 fully with some Fizz and Buzz between the number. Until my roommate pointed it out, I was stucked in the situation. I didn't knoe the problem was that simple. Additionally, I put % 3 == 0 as a first, % 5 == 0 as a second, and % 3 and % 5 at last. The coputer tried to excute the first two, but the last elif component which was if the number is both %3 and %5 wasn't working. My roommate and I figured out that it might be that since it has both element of first two if/else statement, the computer might confused as to why it's in the elif statement. I put the last one on the top and it worked.

## How I overcome it
##### This assignmnet was relatively easier than the pyramid one so I was very close to do all by myself. However, just like for pyramid one, my roommate helped me understand how computer thinks and he pointed out the missing point of my coding.
