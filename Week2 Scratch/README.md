# Scratch Homework

## I tried to make something fun

- I wanted to use dog sprite so not only I made him bark, he's going to sit if I click him
- I wanted to be a little creative, so I put the wizard and made him create a dinosaur

## The one thing I struggled

- To make function **broom** in order to make the broom sprite appear

***My roommate liked it, and I also enjoyed creating it!***
