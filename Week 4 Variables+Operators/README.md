# Mice Homework
## What I did

#### For this assignment, I used a variable, tab/new line, and f-Strings to get the same output as a reference.

## How I did

#### I created a variable using "cat" example from the class material to get the part of the outcome "3". In the result of the variable, I put "Blind" with new line and a tab, and "Mice" with new line and 2 tabs (\n \t Blind \n \t\t Mice"). I put "cat" into the f-Strings and put "Blind" and "Mice" after, and put them in to one pair of parenthsis.


## The problem I faced

#### After I successfully made the variable, I started to work on "Blind" and "Mice". I added new line and tab to "Blind", and new line and 2 tabs for "Mice". I tried to put it after "print", however, I didn't work. I tried to put Blind and Mice into both single and double quotation mark, I tried to put it into parenthsis, curly braces. After I realized that it doesn't work, I asked Rachel for help. She sugested me to put Blind and Mice in the result of the variable. I tried to put them in to the variable. I tried the same stuff I did; put it into parenthsis, quotation mark,,, It didn't work. 

## How I overcame

#### After attemping multiple times, I asked Rachel if she could help me find what I missed. I was totally forgot to put "cat" into the f-Strings. It was just that.
